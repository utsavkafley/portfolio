        <p>
          As a software engineer, I have gained work experience in my
          internships working with JavaScript and TypeScript along with frontend
          frameworks like Angular and Vue.js I am also familiar with backend
          technologies like .NET Core and Node.js and have worked with databases
          like MySQL. Currently, I'm teaching myself React.js to complement my
          frontend skills. I'm also exploring data analysis fundamentals using
          Python, numpy, scipy and pandas. I'm a dedicated and hardworking
          individual who is always looking to learn new things and improve my
          skills. I believe that my unique experiences and robust skill set can
          help contribute to any team's mission.
